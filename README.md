# Notes from Atomic Habits by James Clear

## Summary

1. Introduction
   1. Small habits compound over time and cause remarkable results.
2. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
   1. Success is the product of daily habits not a once in a lifetime transformation.
   2. Habits make a difference once you cross a threshold.
   3. Focus of Systems rather than Goals.
3. How Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)
   1. Rather than setting goals, change your identity to resonate with your goals.
   2. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
4. How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
   1. The purpose of Habits is to solve problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible so that it becomes automatic.
   2. Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves: Cue, Craving, Response and Reward.
   3. To build better habits, you need to make them: obvious, attractive, easy and satisfying.
5. The Man That Didn't Look Right
   1. Once habits become automatic, we stop paying attention and do them automatically.
   2. Process of behavior change starts with awareness.
   3. Habit Score-cards make you more aware of your behavior.
6. The Best Way to Start a New Habit
   1. __Implementation Intention__: A plan you make beforehand about when (time) and where (location) you are going to act. "I will implement [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]".
   2. __Habit Stacking__: How you pair a new habit with a current one. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].
   3. Habits stack successfully when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable i.e. no ambiguity - be specific and clear about the cues.
7. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
   1. Motivation isn't as sustainable as good environmental cues.
   2. Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment. 
   3. Habits get associated not with a single trigger but contexts surrounding the behavior i.e. contexts become cues.
8. The Secret to Self-Control
   1. Self-control is a short term strategy, the long term strategy or the secret to self-control is rooted in environmental changes.
   2. Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
   3. People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting situations i.e. reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
