# Atomic Habits

## Introduction
1. A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly and in many cases, automatically.
2. Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you are willing to stick with them for years.
3. The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our habits.

## The Fundamentals

### 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
1. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
2. Success is the product of daily habits - not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
3. Your outcomes are lagging measure of your habits.
4. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
5. Negative habits compound as well and can lead to detrimental effects.
6. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
7. __Plateau of Latent Potential:__ Habits make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock new levels of performance.
8. The most powerful outcomes are delayed.
9. __Goals vs. Systems__
   1.  Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the process that lead to the results.
   2.  Goals are for setting direction, systems are best for making progress.
   3.  The purpose of goals are to win the game. The purpose of systems is to keep playing.
   4.  It's not about a single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
   5.  Commitment to the process will determine your progress.
   6.  You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

### 2. How Habits Shape Your Identity
1. Layers of Behavior Change are: __Outcomes__, __Processes__ and __Identity__. Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
2. With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve.
3. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.
4. Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. 
5. Behavior that is incongruent with self will not last.
6. It is hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past habits.
7. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when the habit becomes a part of your identity.
8. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
9. True behavior change is identity change.
   1.  The goal is not to get better at lifting, it is to be lifter.
   2.  The goal is not to be a better at playing guitar, it is to be a virtuoso. 
   3.  The goal is not to be a better at engineering, it is be an exceptional engineer.
10. Once a person believes in a particular part aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
11. The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.
12. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Your habits are how you embody your identity.
13. Repetition of a habit reinforces identity. Even if you miss doing a habit, the goal is to be winning a majority of the time.
14. 2 Step Change Process:
    1.  Decide the type you want to be.
    2.  Prove it to yourself with small wins.
15. Formation of habits is a two-way street:
    1.  Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
16. Habits aren't about having something but becoming someone.

### 3. How To Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
1. Habits are simple, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.
   1. Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.
2. Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.
3. As habits are created, the level of activity in our brain decreases.
   1. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.
4. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
5. 4 Steps of Building a Habit:
   1. __Cue__: A cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
      1. A cue is about noticing a reward.
   2. __Craving__: Motivational force behind every habit. 
      1. What you crave isn't the habit but the changed state that the habit delivers. 
      2. Cravings encompass the thoughts, feelings and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
      3. The craving is about wanting the reward.
   3. __Response__: The actual habit you perform, which takes the form of a thought or action.
      1. A habit can only occur if you are capable of doing it.
      2. The response is about doing something to get the reward.
   4. __Reward__: The end goal of every habit.
      1. We chase rewards because:
         1. They satisfy your cravings.
         2. They teach us.
6. The 4 steps of building a habit form a neurological feedback loop called a __Habit Loop__.
   1. They led to forming automatic habits.
   2. The reward, through repetition, is associated with the cue and the cycle continues.
      1. Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward -----> [Cycle back]
7. Phase Wise Split of the 4 Steps
   1. __Problem Phase__: Cue and Craving
   2. __Solution Phase__: Response and Reward
8. 4 Laws of Behavioral Change
   1.  How to Create a Good Habit - Make it:
       1. Obvious (Cue) 
       2. Attractive (Craving)
       3. Easy (Response)
       4. Satisfying (Reward)
   2.  How to Break a Bad Habit - Make it:
       1. Invisible (Cue)
       2. Unattractive (Craving)
       3. Difficult (Response)
       4. Unsatisfying (Reward)

## The 1st Law: Make it Obvious

### 4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right
1. Since habits are so well encoded via automatic cues, we must begin the process of behavioral change with awareness i.e. we need to get a handle on current ones.
2. __Pointing and Calling__ is a system designed to reduce mistakes where every detail is identified, pointed at and named aloud. For example, used in Japanese railways.
   1. It is effective because it raises the level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious one.
   2. It prevents the problem of "when we've done something a thousand times before, we tend to overlook things."
3. A Habit Score card similar to a Pointing and Call system helps raise awareness about our entrenched habits.
   1. Process is to make a list of our daily habits and for each behavior add:
      1. "+" if it is a good habit.
      2. "-" if it is a bad habit.
      3. "=" if it is a neutral habit.
   2. Only a long term perspective should be used to categorize habits into good, bad or neutral.
   3. Question if a habit reinforces your desired identity.
   4. Hearing your bad habits said out aloud makes the consequences seem more real.

### 5. The Best Way To Start a New Habit
1. Two most common cues are: time and location.
2. __Implementation Intention__: A plan you make beforehand about when and where you are going to act i.e. how you plan to implement a particular habit.
   1. Format: "When X situation arises, I will perform response Y".
   2. People who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through.
   3. Many people think they lack motivation but what they lack is clarity.
   4. Simple strategy for Effective Implementation Intention: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
   5. The goal where is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can't say why.
   6. When your dreams are vague, it is easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.
3. __Habit Stacking__: One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit and stack new behavior on top of it.
   1. "After [Current Habit], I will [New Habit]"
   2. Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you'll stick with a habit by stacking new behavior on top of your old one.
   3. Habit stacking also allows you to create a simple set of rules that guide your future behavior.
   4. The secret to creating a successful habit stack is to select the right cue to kick things off.
      1. Consider when you are likely to be most successful.
      2. Your cue should be the same frequency as your habit.
      3. __Habit stacking works when the cue is highly *specific* and *immediately actionable*.
         1. Reduce all ambiguity.
         2. Be specific and clear: the most tightly bound your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will notice when the times comes to act.
   5. __Diderot Effect__: Obtaining new possessions often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases. 

### 6. Motivation is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More
1. Every habit is context dependent - we are changed by the world around us.
2. __Levin's Equation__: Behavior is a function of the person and their environment. B = *f*(P,E)
   1. __Suggestion Impulse Buying__: Levin's Equation in practice is a trigger when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.
      1. In other words, a customer won't buy the product because they need it but because how it is presented.
3. Many actions we take daily are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option.
4. Visual cues are the greatest catalysts of our behavior.
5. Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
6. Creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention towards a desired habit.
7. If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make a cue a big part of your environment.
8. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you'll think about your habit throughout the day.
   1. Make sure the best choice is the most obvious one.
9. Be the designer of your world and not merely a consumer of it.
10. Your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior.
11. Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by our relationship to them.
12. Start thinking about your environment not as filled with objects but with relationships.
    1.  Think of how you interact with the space around you.
13. You can train yourself to link a particular habit to a particular context.
14. Habits can be easier to change in a new environment.
15. One space, one use - separate spaces for vital things.
16. A stable environment where everything has a place and purpose is an environment where habits can be formed.

### 7. The Secret to Self-Control
1. Robin's study of heroin addicted veterans concluded that addictions could spontaneously be dissolved if there is a radical change in environment.
2. Create an environment devoid of triggers. When the context changes, so does the habit.
3. Reducing environmental stimuli to decrease proclivity of addictions goes against the conventional association of unhealthy behavior and moral weakness or will power.
4. People better at structuring their lives in a way that doesn't require heroic willpower and self-control i.e. they spend less time in tempting situations.
5. People with the best self-control are the ones who need to use it the least. Self-restraint is easiest when you don't have to use it often.
6. People get disciplined by creating a more disciplined environment.
7. Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear.
8. Bad habits are __autocatalytic__: a process that feeds itself. They foster feelings they try to numb.
9. __Cue Induced Wanting__: An external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. For example, Shaming obese people with weight-loss presentation can get them anxious and repeat overeating.
10. You can break a habit, but you're unlikely to forget it.
    1.  Self-control can only get you so far.
    2.  Environmental-change is for the long term.
11. It's impossible to sustainably stick to positive habits in a negative environment.
12. One of the most practical way of getting rid of bad habits is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.
13. Make the cues of bad habits invisible.
    1.  Removing a single cue that triggers a bad habit, the entire habit fades away.
14. __Secret to Self-control__: Optimizing your environment that sets off cues for bad habits. Make the cues of good habits obvious and bad habits, invisible.

## The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

### 8. How To Make a Habit Irresistible
1. __Supernormal Stimulus__: A heightened version of reality that elicits a stronger response than usual.
   1. __Junk Food__ 
      1. The human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar and fat. This food was quite rare in the environment of our ancestors and not knowing where our ancestor's meal was coming from, eating as much as possible increased the likelihood of survival.
      2. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond the evolutionary purpose.
      3. The modern food industry's primary goal is to make more money and therefore, they get people addicted to food by taking advantage of genetically encoded habits from our ancestors to eat as much sugar, fat and salt.
      4. __Orosentation__: How a product feels in your mouth. The modern food industry optimizes for this to trigger consumers to eat more. Overeating hyperpalatable foods, in other words, is attractive to the human brain and therefore, causes us to gain more weight.
      5. The __bliss point__ for each product is researched every year to optimize the dopamine hits.
   2. __Porn__
      1. Splicing together stimulating scenes at a rate impossible to replicate in real life gets everyone hooked.
      2. The supernormal stimulus here is the instant gratification via dopamine flooding achieved from the biological need to procreate.
   3. __Social Media__
      1. More "likes" or digital praises triggers dopamine more than one could achieve in an in person conversation.
   4. __Advertising__
      1. Ideal lighting, professional make-up and photoshopped edits make the desire to buy the product more attractive.
      2. Mannequins with exaggerated and over sexualized features to sell products.
2. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.
3. Compared to nature, these pleasure packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.
4. Using this knowledge, to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive.
