# Atomic Habits

## Introduction
1. A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly and in many cases, automatically.
2. Changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you are willing to stick with them for years.
3. The quality of our lives depends on the quality of our habits.

## The Fundamentals

### 1. The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits
1. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
2. Success is the product of daily habits - not once-in-a-lifetime transformations.
3. Your outcomes are lagging measure of your habits.
4. Good habits make time your ally. Bad habits make time your enemy.
5. Negative habits compound as well and can lead to detrimental effects.
6. Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.
7. __Plateau of Latent Potential:__ Habits make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock new levels of performance.
8. The most powerful outcomes are delayed.
9. __Goals vs. Systems__
   1.  Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the process that lead to the results.
   2.  Goals are for setting direction, systems are best for making progress.
   3.  The purpose of goals are to win the game. The purpose of systems is to keep playing.
   4.  It's not about a single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement.
   5.  Commitment to the process will determine your progress.
   6.  You don't rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

### 2. How Habits Shape Your Identity
1. Layers of Behavior Change are: __Outcomes__, __Processes__ and __Identity__. Outcomes are about what you get. Processes are about what you do. Identity is about what you believe.
2. With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve.
3. With identity-based habits, the focus is on who you wish to become.
4. Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. 
5. Behavior that is incongruent with self will not last.
6. It is hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past habits.
7. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when the habit becomes a part of your identity.
8. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
9. True behavior change is identity change.
   1.  The goal is not to get better at lifting, it is to be lifter.
   2.  The goal is not to be a better at playing guitar, it is to be a virtuoso. 
   3.  The goal is not to be a better at engineering, it is be an exceptional engineer.
10. Once a person believes in a particular part aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief.
11. The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it.
12. Your identity emerges out of your habits. Your habits are how you embody your identity.
13. Repetition of a habit reinforces identity. Even if you miss doing a habit, the goal is to be winning a majority of the time.
14. 2 Step Change Process:
    1.  Decide the type you want to be.
    2.  Prove it to yourself with small wins.
15. Formation of habits is a two-way street:
    1.  Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits.
16. Habits aren't about having something but becoming someone.

### 3. How To Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps
1. Habits are simple, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.
   1. Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience.
2. Behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.
3. Habits are simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.
4. As habits are created, the level of activity in our brain decreases.
   1. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past.
5. Habits reduce cognitive load and free up mental capacity, so you can allocate your attention to other tasks.
6. 4 Steps of Building a Habit:
   1. __Cue__: A cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior.
      1. A cue is about noticing a reward.
   2. __Craving__: Motivational force behind every habit. 
      1. What you crave isn't the habit but the changed state that the habit delivers. 
      2. Cravings encompass the thoughts, feelings and emotions of the observer are what transform a cue into a craving.
      3. The craving is about wanting the reward.
   3. __Response__: The actual habit you perform, which takes the form of a thought or action.
      1. A habit can only occur if you are capable of doing it.
      2. The response is about doing something to get the reward.
   4. __Reward__: The end goal of every habit.
      1. We chase rewards because:
         1. They satisfy your cravings.
         2. They teach us.
7. The 4 steps of building a habit form a neurological feedback loop called a __Habit Loop__.
   1. They led to forming automatic habits.
   2. The reward, through repetition, is associated with the cue and the cycle continues.
      1. Cue -> Craving -> Response -> Reward -----> [Cycle back]
8. Phase Wise Split of the 4 Steps
   1. __Problem Phase__: Cue and Craving
   2. __Solution Phase__: Response and Reward
9. 4 Laws of Behavioral Change
   1.  How to Create a Good Habit - Make it:
       1. Obvious (Cue) 
       2. Attractive (Craving)
       3. Easy (Response)
       4. Satisfying (Reward)
   2.  How to Break a Bad Habit - Make it:
       1. Invisible (Cue)
       2. Unattractive (Craving)
       3. Difficult (Response)
       4. Unsatisfying (Reward)

## The 1st Law: Make it Obvious

### 4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right
1. Since habits are so well encoded via automatic cues, we must begin the process of behavioral change with awareness i.e. we need to get a handle on current ones.
2. __Pointing and Calling__ is a system designed to reduce mistakes where every detail is identified, pointed at and named aloud. For example, used in Japanese railways.
   1. It is effective because it raises the level of awareness from a non-conscious habit to a more conscious one.
   2. It prevents the problem of "when we've done something a thousand times before, we tend to overlook things."
3. A Habit Score card similar to a Pointing and Call system helps raise awareness about our entrenched habits.
   1. Process is to make a list of our daily habits and for each behavior add:
      1. "+" if it is a good habit.
      2. "-" if it is a bad habit.
      3. "=" if it is a neutral habit.
   2. Only a long term perspective should be used to categorize habits into good, bad or neutral.
   3. Question if a habit reinforces your desired identity.
   4. Hearing your bad habits said out aloud makes the consequences seem more real.
