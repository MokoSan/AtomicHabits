5. Behavior that is incongruent with self will not last.
6. It is hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that led to your past habits.
7. The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when the habit becomes a part of your identity.
8. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
9. True behavior change is identity change.
